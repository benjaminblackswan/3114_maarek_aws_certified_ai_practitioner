## Foundation Model
* very expensive, computational and need lots of data
* examples of companies that train Foundation model are
  - OpenAI
  - Meta
  - Amazon
  - Google
  - Anthropic

## Large Language Models (LLM)
* based on foundation model

## Generative Language Models
* user give prompt
* model use content it has learnt to generate new content
* it is **non-deterministic**, this is because the model used is statistical method, not determinstic method.

# Amazon Benrock
* for building gen AI on aws.
* full managed, pay per use.

# 24. Amazon Bedrock - Foundation Model (FM)

* how to choose which model?
  - type, performance, constraint, compliance
  - customization, model size
  - multimodal models
* Amazon titan

# 26. Amazon Bedrock - Fine-Tuning a Model
* adapt copy of foundation model with your own data
* provision throughput or on-demand

## ways to fine tune (FT)
* instruction based FT
  - domain specific tasks
  - prompt response pair
  - labeled data
  - Single-turn messaging
  - multi-turn messaging
  - cheapter
  - less data
* continued pre-training
  - unlabelled data
  - domain adaptation fine-turning
  - expensive
  - more data
